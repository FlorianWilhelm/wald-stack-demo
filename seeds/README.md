The `cameri_weather.csv` was downloaded from [opendatasoft] using

```commandline
curl -X 'GET' \                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 îœ¼ wald-stack

```

Since the weather data was not always available on every day, following changes were made:

- 2015-09-07 -> 2015-09-06
- 2017-09-04 -> 2017-09-03
- 2018-09-03 -> 2018-09-02


It's public domain.
